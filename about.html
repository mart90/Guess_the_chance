        A simple website where we can guess the probability of events, and we gain or lose rating points based on how well we do. We can guess for any possible event, as long as it's in the future, from esports to politics
        to whatever else you can think of. Essentially, we are betting rating points instead of money.
        <br><br><br>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">How it works</h3>
        <br>
        New events can be suggested by anyone, and will need to be approved by an admin before they are open for guessing. For each event, there's a window in which we can guess, between the start date and the close date.
        We can't see the guesses of other users before we make our own guess. After the close date, when it becomes clear whether the event happened or not, the event is resolved to either "Yes" or "No" by an admin based 
        on the resolution criteria given when the event was suggested. Then, rating points are assigned based on how well we did compared to other users.
        <br><br><br>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Rating system</h3>
        <br>
        Our guess is compared to the average guess of all users. Based on the difference, we are given either a "Yes" share or a "No" share. If we guessed higher than the average, we will gain points if the event happens. If 
        we guessed lower than the average, we gain points if it doesn't happen. So if we guess 80%, that doesn't necessarily mean we are hoping for the event to happen. If everyone else guessed 100%, we profit (a lot) if the 
        event doesn't happen, and we lose if it does. How much we win or lose depends on the difference between our guess and the average guess. We maximize our profit by being close to the average. Ultimately, we maximize our 
        rating by being as close to the real probability of the event as possible.
        <br><br>
        Ratings are then updated using the Elo rating formula. For details, contact me.
